    <p>
        New Year is something that we all look forward to. It marks the beginning of a year and the end to another year.
        Everybody looks forward to begin a new year with great fun and enjoyment and wish that the year ahead brings them in, all goods. I too celebrate this great day with all the blast that I can.
        Two days before the New Year, we start our preparations. We clean our house, get things in order, buy crackers and get them ready and we look forward to the great day. On New Year's Eve is when we enjoy the maximum. From morning, we kids would be busy packing up gifts and planning pranks that could be played when the clock strikes 12.00 at night.

        New Year's Eve is a time of celebration and reflection as people all over the world mark the end of the old year and the start of a new one. It is a time to come together with friends and family, participate in traditional customs, and make plans for the future. Some popular traditions include making resolutions, singing “Auld Lang Syne,” and eating special foods believed to bring good luck.
        Many people also choose to celebrate by attending parties, watching fireworks, and traveling to experience new cultures and customs. As the clock strikes midnight, people often toast with champagne or other sparkling beverages and make a toast to the new year. No matter how people choose to celebrate, New Year's Eve is a time for all to come together and look forward to a new beginning.

    <p>hopping is one of my favorite activities. I love to browse through stores and find new things to buy. I also enjoy finding good deals on items. One of my favorite shopping trips is when I go to a mall and find several stores that have sales. I can spend hours looking for the best deals.

    <p>The second section had cloth shops for children, ladies and gentlemen. We visited to see the clothes but didn't bring any cloth, then we visited some artificial Jewelry shops, cosmetic item shops and footwear shops in that section too. The shops were very decorated and very attractive.
